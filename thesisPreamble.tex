The global mean surface air temperature change in response to global warming, namely climate sensitivity, plays a central role in climate change studies, and the estimates of climate sensitivity depend critically on the climate feedbacks, the processes that can either amplify or dampen the responses of climate system to the external perturbations. The goal of this thesis is to to understand the climate feedbacks through the idealized climate models.

The first part explores the roles of climate feedbacks played in polar amplification of surface temperature change. By running the idealized aquaplanet simulations with a hierarchy of radiation schemes (without sea ice and clouds), and by decomposing the total surface temperature responses into different components through the radiative kernel method, we find the poleward heat transport, the lapse rate and Planck feedbacks contribute to the amplified surface temperature changes in polar region, while the water vapor feedback prefers the tropical temperature change.

The second part investigates the underlying causes of cloud feedback uncertainty with a simple cloud scheme. The scheme diagnoses the cloud fraction from relative humidity and other variables such as inversion strength, and its optical properties such as effective radius and cloud water content are prescribed as simple functions of temperature. The simulations show this scheme can capture the basic feature of cloud climatology. Through a series of perturbed parameter ensemble global warming simulations, part of the inter-model spread of cloud feedbacks among general circulation models can be reproduced, and we find the low cloud amount feedback, especially the one over the low-latitude subsidence regions, is the largest contributor to the net cloud feedback uncertainty. The cloud controlling factor analysis suggests that the sea surface temperature (SST) and estimate inversion strength (EIS) have opposite effects on marine low cloud amounts, but their responses to SST rather than EIS seem to bring much larger uncertainty. Finally, we find the equilibrium climate sensitivity and cloud feedback over tropical subsidence regimes show a robust linear relationship, implying a possible constraint for climate sensitivity.

% First and foremost, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my supervisors, Profs. Mat Collins and Geoff Vallis, for their generous guidance, support, motivation and endless patience. They always encourage me to... Think about big pictures...

% Thank Prof. James Screen for working as an internal examiner for my annual report and for his advice and suggestions during every mini-viva. 
% Many thanks to those who have helped me along the way in Exeter: Dr. Stephen Thompson, Dr. Penny Maher, Dr. Ruth Geen, and Neil Lewis, and other members of the Isca group. I would also like to extend my thanks to the Exeter Climate System (XCS) group and Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics (GAFD) group for organizing so many excellent seminars.

% I would like to acknowledge the joint PhD scholarship from University of Exeter and China Scholarship Council (NO. 201706210070), and I could not finish my PhD study without their support.

% I am incredibly grateful to my family for their continuous care and support over the last four years, especially during the Covid-19 lockdown period. Every week's video chat with my parents, brother and sometimes with my sister have gave me lots of support. My father Shugang and mother Hezhen, who are always there for me when I need any support, advice and help. My elder twin brother Yang, who has obtained his PhD degree two years ago, sets a good example for me to follow. %, and who is always the first person I think of when I want to share some good or bad news.
