First and foremost, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my supervisors, Profs. Mat Collins and Geoff Vallis, for their generous guidance, support, motivation and endless patience. They always encourage me to... Think about big pictures...

Thank Prof. James Screen for working as an internal examiner for my annual report and for his advice and suggestions during every mini-viva. 
Many thanks to those who have helped me along the way in Exeter: Dr. Stephen Thompson, Dr. Penny Maher, Dr. Ruth Geen, and Neil Lewis, and other members of the Isca group. I would also like to extend my thanks to the Exeter Climate System (XCS) group and Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics (GAFD) group for organizing so many excellent seminars.

I would like to acknowledge the joint PhD scholarship from University of Exeter and China Scholarship Council (NO. 201706210070), and I could not finish my PhD study without their support.

I am incredibly grateful to my family for their continuous care and support over the last four years, especially during the Covid-19 lockdown period. Every week's video chat with my parents, brother and sometimes with my sister have gave me lots of support. My father Shugang and mother Hezhen, who are always there for me when I need any support, advice and help. My elder twin brother Yang, who has obtained his PhD degree two years ago, sets a good example for me to follow. %, and who is always the first person I think of when I want to share some good or bad news.
