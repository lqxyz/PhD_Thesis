I would like to acknowledge the joint PhD scholarship from University of Exeter and China Scholarship Council (NO. 201706210070), and I could not finish my PhD study without its support.

Every week's video chat with my parents, brother and sometimes with my sister have gave me lots of support. My father Shugang and mother Hezhen, who are always there for me when I need any support, advice and help. My brother Yang, who has finished his PhD degree two years ago, sets a good example for me to follow. %, and who is always the first person I think of when I want to share some good or bad news.
