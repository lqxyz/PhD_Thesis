\section{Summary and discussions}


\section{Future work}

For the climate feedback part?

For cloud scheme:

Problems of RH schemes?

Diagnostic --> inconsistency between cloud fraction of cloud water?

Aerosol? missing feature of negative optical depth feedback...

Coupling with convection scheme? Cloud life-time?

===============================================

For the cloud feedback:

The perturbation in PPE is so limited: 1. only with the cloud scheme, 2. the perturbation is not enough for the single parameter? increase and/or decrease in a range so as to quantify the roles of the parameters? 

The coupling between clouds and large-scale circulation? Its role in determining the cloud feedback spread?

Pattern effect? difference between Q-flux and AMIP runs?

For ECS?

The role of clouds in polar amplification?
