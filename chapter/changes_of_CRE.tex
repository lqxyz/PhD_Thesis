\chapter{Changes of Cloud Radiative Effect to Global Warming}

\section{Introduction}
In \chapref{ch:eval_cld_scheme} we have evaluated the climatology simulated by the simple cloud scheme when implemented in Isca, and we will investigate how cloud radiative effect responses to climate change in this chapter. 

\section{Data and model setup}
Similar to the setups in \secref{sec:eval_cld_exp_setup}, here the SST has a uniform 4K warming.


\section{Summary and discussion}
